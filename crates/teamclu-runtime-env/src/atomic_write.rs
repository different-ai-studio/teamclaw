//! Atomic file writes for shared config files (notably `opencode.json`).
//!
//! `opencode.json` has many independent writers spread across the daemon, the
//! runtime-env crate, and the desktop process. A plain `std::fs::write` opens
//! with `O_TRUNC`, but the byte stream is written at the fd's own offset — so
//! two concurrent writers of different lengths can leave the shorter object
//! followed by the longer writer's stale tail ("trailing characters at line N").
//!
//! Writing to a unique sibling temp file and `rename`-ing it into place makes
//! every write an all-or-nothing swap: a reader always sees exactly one
//! complete file, and a partial/short writer can never leave stale bytes behind
//! a later writer. The temp name embeds pid + a per-process counter so
//! concurrent writers never clobber each other's temp file either.
