///
/// This replaces the old `Runtime` row. The difference is the key: `Runtime`
/// was keyed by a per-spawn id minted fresh on every start and broadcast on a
/// topic that no longer exists, so it was stale the moment it was written
/// (ADR-0004). An attachment is keyed by `(actor, session)` — a daemon holds
/// at most one attachment per session, so the key is stable across restarts.
///
/// **Absence means cold, not missing.** A session with no attachment row is one
/// no daemon is currently serving; the next message spawns one. That is a
/// normal state, not a failed lookup.
///
/// Fields the old row carried and this one deliberately drops (ADR-0004):
/// `sessionTitle` duplicated `sessions.title`; `currentPrompt`,
/// `lastOutputSummary`, `toolUseCount` and `startedAt` were only snapshotted on
/// discrete lifecycle events and went stale in between. `LiveSession` does not
/// carry them, so there is nothing to project.
