-- claim_team_invite_agent_org.test.sql
--
-- pgTAP tests for daemon org_id stamping on claim (20260611000000 public,
-- 20260618000000 amux — FC calls amux.claim_team_invite):
--   1. Agent claim on an org-stamped team mints a daemon auth user whose
--      raw_app_meta_data carries org_id = teams.oid (new-agent path).
--   2. With that claim in the JWT (as GoTrue would embed it), the daemon user
--      passes teams_org_guard and can SELECT the team row (e.g. share_mode).
--   3. Without the claim, the same daemon user is blocked (regression control
--      — this was the bug: Sync Now → team_share_not_enabled_for_daemon).
--   4. Rebind path (target_actor_id) rotates to a new daemon user that also
--      carries the org claim.
--   5. Agent claim on a team without oid keeps raw_app_meta_data empty.
