/**
 * Keep `Cargo.lock`'s workspace-member entries in step with a version bump.
 *
 * `bump-desktop-version.mjs` rewrites the four canonical version sources, two of
 * which are `Cargo.toml` files. It never touched `Cargo.lock`, and the release
 * workflow commits with `git commit -am` — which only picks up files the bump
 * actually modified. So every release landed on `main` with a lockfile still
 * naming the *previous* version.
 *
 * The lockfile is not wrong for long: the next `cargo` invocation on any machine
 * rewrites those two lines. That is the problem — every developer's first build
 * after a release produces an unrequested `Cargo.lock` diff they have to stash
 * or commit around. Two such stashes were found sitting in one checkout
 * (`beta.4 → beta.6`, `beta.7 → beta.8`), both pure noise.
 *
 * Cargo would derive exactly these lines, so writing them here is not
 * hand-maintaining a lockfile — it is doing the derivation at bump time instead
 * of leaving it to whoever builds next.
