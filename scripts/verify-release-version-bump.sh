# Guard: a live/beta release must bump the bundled amuxd (and desktop) version.
#
# The client only force-upgrades its ~/.amuxd/bin/amuxd when the bundled crate
# version (apps/daemon/Cargo.toml) is strictly greater than the installed one
# (see apps/daemon/src/opencode_install/mod.rs — `satisfied = installed >= bundled`).
# If a release ships with the version unchanged, the new amuxd is bundled but
# never installed. This script fails the release when:
#   1. The four canonical version sources disagree (delegates to
#      check-desktop-version.sh), or
#   2. The release version is not strictly greater than the previous release's.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify-release-version-bump.sh <version> [current-tag]
#     <version>      release version, with or without leading 'v'
#                    (e.g. v0.2.21, 0.2.21, or 0.2.21-beta.1)
#     current-tag    the tag that triggered this run (e.g. v0.2.21), excluded
#                    from the "already released" history so a stable tag-push
#                    doesn't flag itself. Omit for channels (beta) that don't
#                    push a matching git tag.
#
# Only strict semver tags (v<major>.<minor>.<patch>[-pre]) are considered part of
# the release history — stray tags like `v1.0.0-experiment` or `v2-phase-1-done`
# are ignored so they can't skew the comparison.
